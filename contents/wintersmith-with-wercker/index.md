  GitHub Pages is ideal for hosting project sites and personal blogs. The only problem is…Jekyll. If you’re at all like me, stock Jekyll doesn’t cut it. Liquid? Naw, we gotta do it custom. Enter wintersmith and wercker.

GitHub Pages is ideal for hosting project sites and personal blogs. The only problem is...Jekyll. If you're at all like me, stock Jekyll doesn't cut it. Liquid? Naw, we gotta do it *custom*. Enter wintersmith and wercker.

- **[wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/)** is a super-powered static site generator with an amazingly adaptable plugin system, great docs, and a budding community. It's a node app, and uses jade and markdown out of the box.

- **[wercker](http://wercker.com/)** is a hosted continuous integration and deployment platform that allows you to set up custom test and deploy pipelines for all your projects. It integrates with GitHub, and supports node apps with minimal configuration.

We'll walk through the steps to set up wercker to deploy a fresh version of your wintersmith site every time you push to GitHub.

## Sign up for wercker

Signing up for wercker is dead easy. Just go to [wercker.com](http://wercker.com/) and register. Once you've signed up, add your site as an application on wercker. From the home page, click *Add an application* and follow the prompts.

## Building

Before you proceed, make sure you have wintersmith and any plugins added to your `package.json`.

To configure itself, wercker looks for a file called `wercker.yml` in the root of your repo. Add one with these contents:

```yaml
box: wercker/nodejs
build:
  steps:
    - npm-install
    - script:
        name: wintersmith build
        code: ./node_modules/.bin/wintersmith build -o ./build
```

## Set up deployment

Before we set up a deploy target, we need a Personal API Access Token. Go to the [Applications page](https://github.com/settings/applications) in your account settings on GitHub. Click on *Create new token*, and copy the token that appears.

Now create a deploy target on wercker. Go to the Settings tab for your application, click *Add deploy target*, and choose *custom deploy*. Give it a name, and enable *auto deploy successful builds to branches* (add "master"). Add an environment variable and paste the access token from GitHub as the value.

Now we'll add a deploy step to `wercker.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  steps:
    - lukevivier/gh-pages:
        repo: <owner>/<repo>
        token: $GH_TOKEN
        basedir: build
```

`repo` is your own repo. Use the environment variable from the deploy target as the value of `token`. This is so we don't store your top secret access token in a public place. Last, set `basedir` to "build": only the contents of the build directory will be deployed.

### Custom domains

Add a `domain` option to the deploy step if you want a [custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages) file to be created for you automatically.

## Deploy!

Commit `wercker.yml` and push it up to GitHub. On wercker, the Builds tab for your application should show the build in process. If you enabled auto deploy on the deploy target, it will start as soon as the build passes. Otherwise, click on the build and select your target from *Deploy this build* dropdown. After a few moments, your wintersmith site is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

Voila! Now you can use wintersmith for all your project sites and have them deployed automatically when you push to GitHub.
